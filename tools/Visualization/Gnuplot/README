This is a gnuplot script for visualizing jmod.txt as a contour plot.

- It is inteded as a quick check if the integration plane dimensions
  have been chosen correctly. This is useful for planar molecules
  when an integration scan is not needed. However, in case of doubt a
  scan is always recommended.  
- This type of visualization is also helpful in case the radius option
  is needed.
